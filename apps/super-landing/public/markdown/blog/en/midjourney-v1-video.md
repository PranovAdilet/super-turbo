## Quick Tips Before You Prompt

### Camera Verbs = Motion Seeds
Master these cinematic terms to control movement:
- **orbit, dolly-zoom, push-in, tilt-up** - all influence parallax and depth
- **pan, track, crane, zoom** - create professional camera movements
- **handheld, steady-cam, slider** - define camera stability style

### Loop Hygiene
For perfect seamless loops:
- Ask for **endless, seamless, or radial motion**
- Use **circular, rotating, or orbital** movements
- Specify **continuous, infinite, or repeating** actions

### Hide Low Resolution
Disguise 480p limitations with smart composition:
- **Macro shots** - extreme close-ups hide pixel density
- **Silhouettes** - high contrast reduces detail dependency
- **Close-ups** - tight framing masks resolution limits
- **Atmospheric effects** - fog, smoke, particles add perceived quality

### GPU Budget Optimization
- Use **Relax Mode** on Pro plan to batch overnight
- **Upscale first** (U1-U4) before /motion for sharper textures
- **Batch similar prompts** to maximize GPU efficiency

### Prompt Character Limits
- Keep total **
    üí∞ Cost Breakdown
    
      ‚Ä¢ 5-second video = 8 GPU minutes
      ‚Ä¢ Pro plan: ~$0.10 per 5-second clip
      ‚Ä¢ Relax mode: Unlimited (slower queue)
      ‚Ä¢ Extension: +$0.08 per 4-second segment
    
  
  
  
    üìä Traditional vs AI
    
      ‚Ä¢ Traditional animation: $500-5000/clip
      ‚Ä¢ Motion graphics: $200-2000/clip
      ‚Ä¢ Midjourney Motion: $0.10-0.50/clip
      ‚Ä¢ **ROI: 1000-50000% cost savings**
    
  


## Viral Success Case Studies

### Neon Tokyo Cat Loop
- **Platform:** Twitter/X
- **Views:** 2M+ in first week
- **Technique:** 1:1 aspect ratio, perfect loop, neon aesthetic
- **Key:** "cat walks endless neon street, seamless loop, cyberpunk glow --ar 1:1 --video"

### Cosmic Coffee Pour
- **Platform:** Instagram Reels
- **Engagement:** 45% above account average
- **Technique:** Macro food shot with galaxy background
- **Key:** "coffee pour reveals galaxy in cup, macro dolly-in, cosmic steam --video"

### Meme Lord Success
- **Platform:** TikTok
- **Viral Factor:** 500K+ views, 50K+ shares
- **Technique:** Comedy loop with abrupt reset
- **Key:** "office worker discovers Monday, dramatic zoom, world explodes then resets --video"

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Instagram Reels (9:16)
- Use **--ar 9:16** for full-screen mobile
- **3-5 second loops** work best for engagement
- **High contrast** performs well in feeds

### TikTok (9:16 or 1:1)
- **Meme-friendly** content with abrupt resets
- **Text overlays** work well with simple motions
- **Trending audio** can be synced to 5-second loops

### YouTube Shorts (9:16)
- **Extend to 15-21 seconds** for better algorithm performance
- **Tutorial-style** content with clear progressions
- **Hook in first 3 seconds** crucial

### Twitter/X (1:1 or 16:9)
- **Perfect loops** for infinite scroll engagement
- **Artistic/aesthetic** content performs well
- **Quote tweet** potential with surprising elements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Motion Too Subtle
- **Solution:** Add `--motion high` parameter
- **Alternative:** Use stronger camera verbs: "dramatic zoom" vs "gentle zoom"
- **Tip:** Combine camera movement with subject action

### Motion Too Chaotic
- **Solution:** Add `--motion low` for subtlety
- **Alternative:** Use static camera with moving elements
- **Tip:** Focus on one primary motion element

### Poor Loop Quality
- **Solution:** Specify "seamless loop" or "endless" in prompt
- **Alternative:** Use circular/orbital motions
- **Tip:** Avoid linear movements that have clear start/end points

### 480p Resolution Concerns
- **Solution:** Use macro shots, silhouettes, or atmospheric effects
- **Alternative:** Upscale before motion generation
- **Tip:** High contrast and dramatic lighting hide resolution limits

## Future Roadmap & Updates

Based on official announcements and community feedback:

### Expected Q2 2025
- **Higher resolution options** (720p, 1080p)
- **Longer duration support** (up to 60 seconds)
- **Audio integration** capabilities

### Expected Q3 2025
- **Text-to-video** direct generation
- **Multi-shot sequences** support
- **Advanced editing controls**

### Community Requests
- **Batch processing** for multiple images
- **Style consistency** across extended clips
- **Export presets** for different platforms

## FAQ: Midjourney Motion


  
    
      üé¨ How do I create motion videos with Midjourney?
    
    
      First, generate or upload an image to midjourney.com. Click "Animate Image" and choose Auto (instant AI motion) or Manual (custom prompt). Select Low or High motion intensity, then download as MP4 or GIF. Videos start at 5 seconds and can be extended up to 21 seconds total.
    
  

  
    
      üí∞ What does Midjourney Motion cost compared to traditional animation?
    
    
      Motion costs 8√ó regular image generation (about $0.10 per 5-second clip on Pro plan). Traditional animation costs $500-5000 per clip, making Midjourney Motion 1000-50000% more cost-effective. Pro/Mega plans include Relax Mode for unlimited slower generations.
    
  

  
    
      üì± What's the best aspect ratio and length for social media?
    
    
      Use --ar 9:16 for Instagram Reels/TikTok, --ar 1:1 for Twitter/Instagram feed, --ar 16:9 for YouTube. Keep initial clips 3-5 seconds for maximum engagement, extend to 15-21 seconds for YouTube Shorts algorithm optimization. Perfect loops perform best across all platforms.
    
  

  
    
      üéØ How do I write effective motion prompts under 220 characters?
    
    
      Focus on camera verbs (orbit, dolly-zoom, push-in) and single actions. Use "seamless loop" for perfect loops, "macro push-in" to hide 480p resolution, "reverse time" for satisfying effects. Prioritize action words over descriptions. Example: "cat walks endless neon street, seamless loop, cyberpunk glow --ar 1:1 --video"
    
  

  
    
      üîß How can I improve quality and hide the 480p resolution?
    
    
      Use macro shots, silhouettes, and high-contrast scenes to disguise resolution limits. Upscale images (U1-U4) before applying motion. Add atmospheric effects like fog, smoke, or particles. In post-production, use Gaussian blur radial masks in After Effects to soften edges while keeping center sharp.
    
  

  
    
      üîÑ Can I create longer videos and how do extensions work?
    
    
      Yes! Start with 5-second base, then use "Extend Manual" with new action prompts (e.g., "cat leaps ‚Üí cat lands"). Repeat up to 4 times for 21-second total. Each extension continues from the last frame. Use different prompts for each extension to create narrative sequences or keep the same prompt for longer continuous motion.
