# Local Storage Persistence Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Summary

Implemented local storage persistence for generated images and videos in `/tools/image-generator` and `/tools/video-generator` pages. Users can now return to these pages and see their previously generated content, providing better continuity and user experience.

## Feature Details

### User Experience Improvements

#### Before

- Generated images/videos disappeared when leaving the page
- No history or persistence of generated content
- Users had to regenerate content if they accidentally navigated away

#### After

- **Automatic Persistence**: All generated images and videos are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Restoration on Return**: When users revisit tools pages, previous generations are loaded
- **Gallery History**: Users can browse through their generation history
- **Persistent Actions**: Delete and clear operations work with localStorage

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Local Storage Utilities (`lib/utils/local-storage.ts`)

**Core Functions:**

```typescript
// Image storage
export function saveImage(image: StoredImage): void;
export function getStoredImages(): StoredImage[];
export function deleteStoredImage(imageId: string): void;
export function clearStoredImages(): void;

// Video storage
export function saveVideo(video: StoredVideo): void;
export function getStoredVideos(): StoredVideo[];
export function deleteStoredVideo(videoId: string): void;
export function clearStoredVideos(): void;

// Utility
export function getStorageUsage(): {
  images: number;
  videos: number;
  totalSizeKB: number;
};
```

**Storage Structure:**

```typescript
export interface StoredImage {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  prompt: string;
  timestamp: number;
  settings: {
    model: string;
    style: string;
    resolution: string;
    shotSize: string;
    seed?: number;
    batchSize?: number;
  };
  projectId?: string;
  requestId?: string;
}

export interface StoredVideo {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  prompt: string;
  timestamp: number;
  settings: {
    model: string;
    style: string;
    resolution: string;
    shotSize: string;
    duration: number;
    frameRate: number;
    seed?: number;
  };
  fileId?: string;
  requestId?: string;
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
}
```

#### 2. Image Generator Integration (`app/tools/image-generator/hooks/use-image-generator.ts`)

**Auto-Loading:**

- `useEffect` loads stored images on component mount
- Converts `StoredImage[]` to `GeneratedImage[]` format
- Populates `generatedImages` state with previous generations

**Auto-Saving:**

- `handleGenerationSuccess` saves completed images to localStorage
- Includes all metadata (prompt, settings, URLs, timestamps)
- Prevents duplicate saves with URL and timestamp checking

**State Synchronization:**

- `deleteImage` removes from both state and localStorage
- `clearAllImages` clears both state and localStorage
- Console logging for debugging storage operations

#### 3. Video Generator Integration (`app/tools/video-generator/hooks/use-video-generator.ts`)

**Implementation Pattern:**

- Mirrors image generator architecture for consistency
- Auto-loads stored videos on mount
- Auto-saves completed videos with metadata
- Synchronized delete/clear operations

**Video-Specific Features:**

- Supports thumbnail URLs for video previews
- Includes video-specific settings (duration, frameRate)
- Handles fileId-based tracking for SSE connections

#### 4. Storage Management

**Capacity Limits:**

- Images: Maximum 50 items stored
- Videos: Maximum 30 items stored
- Automatic trimming of oldest items when limits exceeded

**Data Safety:**

- Safe localStorage operations with error handling
- SSR-compatible (checks for `window` availability)
- Graceful fallbacks when localStorage is unavailable
- Prevention of storage overflow

**Storage Organization:**

- Separate keys for images and videos
- Timestamp-based sorting (newest first)
- Duplicate prevention by ID and URL+timestamp

## Storage Keys

```typescript
const IMAGES_STORAGE_KEY = "super-chatbot-generated-images";
const VIDEOS_STORAGE_KEY = "super-chatbot-generated-videos";
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing functionality unchanged
- No breaking changes to generation workflow
- Graceful handling of missing/corrupted localStorage data
- Progressive enhancement approach

## User Interface Impact

### Tools Pages Experience

1. **Initial Load**: Previously generated content appears automatically
2. **Generation**: New content is added to both current session and storage
3. **Navigation**: Content persists across page reloads and browser sessions
4. **Management**: Delete/clear operations affect both display and storage

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal impact on generation performance
- localStorage operations are asynchronous where possible
- Efficient serialization with size monitoring
- Storage cleanup prevents indefinite growth

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] Images save automatically after generation
- [ ] Videos save automatically after generation
- [ ] Stored content loads on page refresh
- [ ] Delete operations remove from storage
- [ ] Clear operations empty storage
- [ ] Duplicate prevention works correctly

### Edge Cases

- [ ] localStorage unavailable (private browsing)
- [ ] Storage quota exceeded
- [ ] Corrupted localStorage data
- [ ] SSR compatibility (no window object)
- [ ] Large file URLs and metadata

### User Experience

- [ ] Seamless loading of previous generations
- [ ] No performance degradation during generation
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for storage operations
- [ ] Consistent behavior across browser sessions

## Files Modified

1. `lib/utils/local-storage.ts` - **NEW**: Core storage utilities
2. `app/tools/image-generator/hooks/use-image-generator.ts` - Added localStorage integration
3. `app/tools/video-generator/hooks/use-video-generator.ts` - Added localStorage integration
4. `docs/maintenance/changelog/local-storage-persistence-implementation.md` - This documentation

## Storage Capacity

**Estimated Storage Usage:**

- Image entry: ~500-800 bytes (URL + metadata)
- Video entry: ~600-900 bytes (URL + metadata + optional thumbnail)
- Total capacity: ~50-70KB for full storage (within localStorage limits)

**Storage Monitoring:**

```typescript
const usage = getStorageUsage();
console.log(
  `Storage: ${usage.images} images, ${usage.videos} videos, ${usage.totalSizeKB}KB`
);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export/Import**: Allow users to backup/restore their generation history
2. **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud storage integration for cross-device access
3. **Search/Filter**: Add search and filtering capabilities for stored content
4. **Metadata Enhancement**: Store more detailed generation parameters
5. **Preview Optimization**: Thumbnail generation for faster loading
6. **Storage Analytics**: Usage statistics and cleanup recommendations

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Public URLs only (no authentication tokens)
- Client-side storage only (no server persistence)
- User-controlled data retention
- Safe serialization practices
