# Image Generation File Event Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Component**: Image Generator Tool

## Issue Description

Image generator was not receiving generated images from the SuperDuperAI backend because it was only handling `render_progress` and `render_result` SSE events, but the backend was actually sending `file` type events for completed generations.

## Root Cause

The `use-image-generator.ts` hook was missing the `file` event handler that was already implemented in the video generator. The backend was generating images successfully but the frontend couldn't receive them due to unhandled event types.

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Added file event handler** in `app/tools/image-generator/hooks/use-image-generator.ts`:

   - Added handling for `message.type === 'file'` events
   - Added image file type validation (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif, bmp, svg)
   - Added content-type validation for `image/*` MIME types
   - Added debug logging for file events

2. **Fixed file_id to URL resolution**:

   - Added logic to handle project data containing `file_id` instead of direct `url`
   - Integrated `FileService.fileGetById()` to resolve file URLs from file IDs
   - Enhanced both polling and manual check functions to fetch file details
   - Improved error handling for file service calls

3. **Enhanced SSE connection reliability**:

   - Added 10-second timeout for SSE connection establishment
   - Improved fallback to polling when SSE fails to connect
   - Added task completion event handling to trigger polling

4. **Enhanced SSE connection reliability**:

   - Added 10-second timeout for SSE connection establishment
   - Improved fallback to polling when SSE fails to connect
   - Added task completion event handling to trigger polling

5. **Added manual results checking**:

   - Added `forceCheckResults` function to manually check for completed images
   - Added UI button to trigger manual check during processing
   - Improved user control when SSE events are delayed or missing

6. **Improved debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging for all SSE event types
   - Added file type detection logging
   - Added better error context for unhandled events

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Added file event handling in SSE message handler
} else if (message.type === 'file' && message.object?.url) {
  // AICODE-NOTE: Fallback for different event format - handles file event
  console.log('üì° Image file event received:', message.object);
  const imageUrl = message.object.url;

  // Check if it's an image file
  if (imageUrl.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|webp|gif|bmp|svg)$/i) ||
      message.object.contentType?.startsWith('image/')) {
    console.log('üñºÔ∏è ‚úÖ Image completed via file event:', imageUrl);
    handleGenerationSuccess(imageUrl, projectId);
  } else {
    console.log('üì° ‚ö†Ô∏è File event received but not an image file:', {
      url: imageUrl,
      contentType: message.object.contentType
    });
  }
} else if (message.type === 'task_status' && message.object?.status === 'COMPLETED') {
  // AICODE-NOTE: Task completion event - trigger polling to get results
  console.log('üì° Task completed, triggering polling check');
  startPolling(projectId);
} else {
  // Log all other events for debugging
  console.log('üì° Other image SSE event:', message.type, message);
}
```

## Testing

‚úÖ Image generation now successfully receives files via `file` events  
‚úÖ SSE connection more reliable with timeout fallback  
‚úÖ Polling backup works when SSE fails  
‚úÖ Manual "Check for results" button works during processing  
‚úÖ Debug logging provides better insight into event flow

## Impact

- **Fixed**: Image generation results not appearing in UI
- **Improved**: SSE connection reliability
- **Enhanced**: Error handling and debugging capabilities
- **Aligned**: Image generator behavior with video generator
