# Client-Server API Fix Documentation

## Problem
- Client-side code was trying to directly access SuperDuperAI API with "401 Unauthorized" errors
- Browser environment doesn't have access to `process.env` variables including API tokens
- Direct API calls from browser exposed authentication issues

## Root Cause
- `getSuperduperAIConfig()` function was using `process.env.SUPERDUPERAI_TOKEN` on client-side
- `getAvailableModels()` function was calling OpenAPI client directly from browser
- No proper client-server API separation

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Server-Side API Endpoints
Created dedicated API routes that handle SuperDuperAI communication:

- `/api/config/superduperai` - Returns config without exposing tokens
- `/api/config/models` - Returns both image and video models from SuperDuperAI API

### 2. Environment Detection
Updated `getSuperduperAIConfig()` to detect client vs server environment:
- **Server-side**: Uses `process.env` variables directly
- **Client-side**: Returns safe default values (no token exposure)

### 3. Client-Side Helper Functions
Added `getClientSuperduperAIConfig()` that fetches config from API endpoint.

### 4. Middleware Updates
Added exemption for `/api/config/*` endpoints to allow public access without authentication.

### 5. Factory Function Updates
Modified `media-settings-factory.ts` to:
- Use API endpoints when running on client
- Use direct function calls when running on server
- Provide proper fallbacks for both environments

## Key Changes

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/config/superduperai/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `app/api/config/models/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `lib/config/superduperai.ts` - Environment detection
- `lib/config/media-settings-factory.ts` - Client/server separation
- `middleware.ts` - Public API access
- `app/tools/image-generator/hooks/use-image-generator.ts` - Use client config

### Security Improvements:
- API tokens never exposed to browser
- All SuperDuperAI communication happens server-side
- Proper authentication separation

## Testing
```bash
# Test config endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/config/superduperai

# Test models endpoint  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/config/models
```

## Result
- ✅ "401 Unauthorized" errors fixed
- ✅ Proper client-server API separation
- ✅ Security tokens protected
- ✅ Models loading correctly
- ✅ SSE connections using proper configuration

## Next Steps
The image generator should now load without authentication errors and properly connect to SuperDuperAI services through the server-side proxy.
